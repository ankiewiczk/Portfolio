      	This is  a visual representation of how Euclid solved the greatest common
        denominator between two numbers by factoring in the squares that fit in a rectangle
        of length and width of the two factors. I use three rotating colors to highlight each
        iteration of the algorithm.  I also scale the rectangles to be as big as possible given
        the window size.  In future improvements, I would like to iterate through each step 
        on a given mouseclick or maybe even add a slider so you can step through the algorithm forward and backward.
